# tinywebdb
These are the files necessary in order to make a custom TinyWebDB for the MIT AppInventor 2.


#### Requirements


These files do not run on a normal webserver. They are specifically intended to run on a Google WebEngine Server, just like the original code.
You will need the Google App Engine SDK for python and a Google Cloud Console account. For a tutorial visit this page: http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/content/custom-tinywebdb-service.html



###### Python version: 2.7
###### Django version: 1.2

#### Hint

"TinyWebDB" let's you run the service with a web interface, but be careful! Everyone knowing the URL could possibly alter data.

"TinyWebDB no_interface" let's you run the same service, but without any web interface. That means everything has to be done over the Google Cloud Console.
