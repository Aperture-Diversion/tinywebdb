This is the development branch for the custom TinyWebDB. I'm making potentially unstable changes here, so if you want to have a stable TinyWebDB, please download the files from the stable ```master``` branch.
If, after testing, these files prove to be stable enough, I will merge them into master.

## Directories

```TinyWebDB``` let's you run the service with a web interface, but be careful since everyone knowing the URL could easily alter your data!

```TinyWebDB no_interface``` let's you run the same service, but without any web interface at all. That means everything has to be done over the Google Cloud Console. The advantage is that you don't have to care about the web frontend.
